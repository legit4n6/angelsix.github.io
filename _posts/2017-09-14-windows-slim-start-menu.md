In my continued efforts to clean up the Windows 10 UI another thing that has annoyed me since it's release is the oversized, over-invasive start menu with all of its **Pictures**, **Calendar**, **Games I Never Installed** and other advertising and details about my machine and account showing every time I just open the start menu.

So this is what it usually looks like (I've cleaned mine up some already at this point):

So cleaning this up is pretty easy, but yet many people don't realize you can. Open the start menu then **right-click** on any item and click `Unpin from Start`

Once you have unpinned all items, close and re-open the start menu and now you have a nice slim menu :+1:
