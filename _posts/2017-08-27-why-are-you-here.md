For those of you who already know me, you probably know I have a [YouTube channel][youtube-url].

That has generated a lot of interest and I get a lot of questions, comments and requests now. Some things are small, simple and really don't warrant a full video being made.

In order to answer those smaller questions, as well as to post any small hint, tip or cool software thing I am doing on that particular day I figured a simple small blog would be a good place for it.

So, that is why you are here. You will find smaller posts about anything on my mind, possibly answering questions from YouTube or just providing a nice little software/hardware tip.

Stay tuned!
