As many of you who follow what I do will know, I like things dark. I don't like the white glare of a computer screen.

I am sure at least some of you use [Slack](http://www.slack.com) for your work communications? If not I strongly recommend you check it out.

The only down-side is it doesn't yet have a dark theme. So looking around the internet I found plenty of ways to do it by just editing the [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) app javascript files and injecting a custom css sheet.

So, in order to do this now before Slack officially supports it, do the following:

 - Press <kbd>Win + R</kbd> to open `Run...` in Windows
 - Type `%LOCALAPPDATA%` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open your current users `AppData` folder, such as `C:\Users\luke\AppData\Local`
 - Go into `slack\app-2.x.x\resources\app.asar.unpacked\src\static` and open the **ssb-interop.js** file
 - Add the following to the end of the **ssb-interop.js** file

```
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  $.ajax({
    
    url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelsix/youtube/develop/Windows%2010%20Dark%20Theme/Slack/slack-dark.css',
    success: function(css) {
      $("<style></style>").appendTo('head').html(css);
    }
  }); 
 });
```

 - Now close Slack (including in the Taskbar)

 - Restart Slack to see the lovely new dark theme :smiley:
